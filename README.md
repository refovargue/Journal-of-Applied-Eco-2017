  This file contains the MATLAB code used to simulate population dynamics and fishery take on the Great Barrier Reef. 
  
  Input variables to the function:
    MPAs - IDs of reefs that are under protection in a particular configuration;
    Tmax - number of years to simulate;
    Alpha, Beta - Beverton-Holt parameters;
    M_effect - fishing pressure;
    reef_size - carrying capacity for each reef;
    IR - option to limit reefs included in analysis;
